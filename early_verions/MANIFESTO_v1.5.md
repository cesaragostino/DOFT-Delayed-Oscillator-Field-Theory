## 0) Golden rule & scope
- DOFT operates **only with delays and resonance**; no imported metrics or external fields.  
- **Internal coherence dominates:** every addition must fit operational definitions.  
- **Falsifiability first:** all claims must lead to measurable or simulatable contradictions.

---

## 1) Core Premises (Unified)

1. **Delayed Oscillator Core (RE).** Each coupling features a per-link delay defining local time.  
2. **Loop-Closure (RCB).** A loop remains coherent when phase misfit is within tolerance; tolerance tightens as energy decays.  
3. **Composite Interference (IC).** Interference modulates effective delay but does not create new REs.  
4. **Relational Space & Cyclic Time.** Space emerges from propagation delays; time is counted in cycles.  
5. **Abrupt Creation, Layered Evolution.** Creation occurs as shocks; evolution proceeds by layers.  
6. **Destruction Requires Cycles.** Collapse demands several cycles, creating observable hysteresis.  
7. **Cavity + Skin.** A coherent interior bounded by a marginally static skin.  
8. **Skin Gating & Pulses.** The skin filters frequencies, transmitting in short duty windows.  
9. **Regimes & Breakpoint (R_*).** Transition from clean (few modes) to dirty (many surface modes).  
10. **Propagation Measure — LPC(t).** Layers-per-cycle decreases from early high speed to convergence.  
11. **Pulsed/Breathing Propagation.** The skin opens and closes quasi-periodically, yielding pulse trains.  
12. **Skin States.** Defined by radial/tangential closure with tolerance margins μ.  
13. **Anisotropy & Joints.** Asphericity and loop incompatibility create hotspots and lower R_*.  
14. **Delay Kernel & Operational Noise.** Delay distribution defines noise via off-harmonic power.  
15. **Residual Floor.** Collapse leaves structural and asymptotic floors (A/B).  
16. **Parametric Resonance.** Time-modulated delay/tolerance yields Floquet-type nonreciprocal modes.

## 2) Operational Formulation
Define effective delay:

\[
\tau_{eff}(t) = \tau_{RE} [1 + \sigma_{IC}(t)] / d_{skin}(t),
\quad LPC(t) = 1/\tau_{eff}(t)
\]

Observables: \(P_{DOFT}\) (decoherence flux), off-harmonics Φ, rest duty %, effective delay, breakpoint R_*, spectral tilt n_DOFT.

---

## 3) Predictions & Verification
- f ∝ 1/R in clean regime.  
- Breakpoint R_* visible in log P_DOFT vs log R.  
- Rest duty collapses near R_*.  
- Φ rises with interference complexity.  
- LPC(t) converges during structure build-up.  
- Parametric resonance exhibits threshold δ_c and NR(dB) > 0.

---

## 4) Memory, Inertia & Metaestability
- Memory = retained correlation over cycles.  
- Inertia = accumulated memory × structural persistence.  
- Metaestability = balance of chaos (noise) and order (memory) where λ_Lyap ≈ 0.  
- Condition: ρ = σ_int/σ_ext ≈ 1 (entropy produced ≈ entropy exported).

---

## 5) Cluster Formation
Clusters are **resonances linked by finite delays**.  
Propagation sequence introduces **retardation**, generating causal order and distance.  
Clusters store layered memory: each element modulates the next.

## 6) Physical Equivalence Across Domains
| Domain | Mechanism of Memory | Equivalent DOFT Construct |
|---------|--------------------|----------------------------|
| Quantum | Phase coherence | Elementary RE |
| Chemical | Oscillatory cycles | Layered interference IC |
| Biological | Genetic/synaptic storage | Skin + residual floor |
| Cognitive | Neural attractors | LPC(t) convergence |
| Symbolic | Language recursion | Cluster propagation |
| Technological | Feedback networks | Parametric modulation |

## 7) Unified Physical Framework — Resonance–Memory–Cluster Model

### 7.1 The Bit as Persistent Difference
The fundamental bit = **minimum stable asymmetry** in a resonant field.  
Persistence = phase continuity.

### 7.2 Resonance as Memory
A resonance is **a fluctuation that replays itself**.  
When coupled with delay, it becomes a **cycle of memory** — the first form of “history”.

### 7.3 Layered Memory
Each layer stores correlations of the previous one:
\[
M_{\ell} = \alpha_{\ell} r_{\ell}^2 - (\beta_{\ell} N_{\ell} + \lambda_{\ell}) M_{\ell} + \sum_k A_{\ell k} M_k
\]
creating depth and temporal inertia.

### 7.4 Cluster and Delay
Propagation between resonances adds **temporal sequence**.  
Delays (τ) encode spatialization: time-ordering becomes geometry.

### 7.5 Metaequilibrium
System lives at boundary where noise ≈ memory, order regenerates through controlled chaos.

## 8) Ladrillo Universal (Universal Brick)
The base unit of all structure = **auto-sustained oscillation with feedback and delay**.  
All systems —from quantum coherence to culture— are configurations of these bricks.  
Clusters = meta-resonances of such bricks.

---

## 9) Simulation Protocols & Observables
Keep previous v1.4.1 metrics + add new ones:
- r_hat = σ(a1 μ + a2 rest% - a3 Φ)
- M_hat = r_hat² / (ε + Φ) × (1 / (ε + P_DOFT_norm))
- N_hat = b1 Φ + b2 Var(d_skin) + b3 σ_IC
- ρ_est = Φ / P_DOFT_norm  
Add to runs.csv: r_hat, M_hat, N_hat, ρ_est, lambda_lyap_est.

## 10) Philosophical Context
> The universe began to remember when a fluctuation found its own echo.  
> From that moment, every layer of reality —from particles to thought— has been a way of **sustaining difference through resonance**.

Life, mind, and technology are **forms of extended resonance**, each with growing memory depth and slower relaxation.  
The DOFT framework formalizes this continuum through measurable oscillatory constructs.
