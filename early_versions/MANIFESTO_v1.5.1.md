# DOFT — MANIFESTO v1.6 (Grand Integrated + Global Memory / Bell Constraints)

> **Status:** Research Alpha  
> **Version:** 1.6 (Grand integration of v1.3 + v1.4.1c + Resonance–Memory–Cluster + Global/Local Memory & Bell)  
> **License:** MIT

This manifesto consolidates **all** essential content from **v1.3** and **v1.4.1c**, and integrates the unified physical interpretation developed later (bit → resonance → memory → cluster → meta‑stability → complexity), **plus** a new Part VIII on **local vs global memory** and the project’s **Bell‑safe** position.

It is intentionally long: a **single source of truth** for the program.

---

## 0) Golden rule & scope
- DOFT operates **only with delays and resonance**; no imported fields/metrics beyond what is defined here.  
- **Internal coherence dominates.** Every new element must fit the operational definitions.  
- **Falsifiability first.** Every claim must map to an experiment/simulation that can contradict it.  
- **Local abruptness, not global instantaneous.** Respect finite delays throughout.  
- **Metrics over metaphors.** Reduce ideas to measurable quantities in DOFT units (cycles, layers).

---

## Part I — Foundations from DOFT v1.3 (Preserved & Consolidated)

### 1. One‑page overview (v1.3 snapshot)
- **Ontology.** Graph of identical **oscillators** (nodes) coupled by **links with finite delays**. Spacetime and causality emerge from this delay structure.  
- **Dynamics.** Each node follows a **delay differential equation (DDE)** with damping, weak stochastic floor, and nonlinear delayed coupling. Delays may be **state‑dependent** (backreaction).  
- **Emergence.** Coarse‑graining yields a **wave‑with‑memory PDE**, an **effective index of refraction** \(n_\mathrm{eff}(x)\) from delay gradients, and **holonomy** phases on cycles (loop primacy).  
- **Constants.** A **speed ceiling** \(c \approx a/\tau_0\) emerges (link scale over minimal delay). An effective **\(\hbar_\mathrm{eff}\)** arises from action/area of steady cycles sustained by the noise floor. A **\(G\)**‑like constant maps to delay‑sensitivity to local energy.  
- **Phenomenology.** Rydberg/QDT‑like spectra via short holonomy loops; **analogue gravity** (horizons from \(n_\mathrm{eff}\) gradients); matter/antimatter curvature parity.  
- **Testability.** Cross‑domain predictions; self‑averaging diagnostics; kernel ID (Prony/Vector‑Fitting); scaling laws for \(\hbar_\mathrm{eff}\).

### 2. Axioms (v1.3)
- **A0 — Law of Preservation of Chaos (LPC).**  
  \(\frac{d\mathcal{K}}{dt}=\Phi_\mathrm{in}-\Phi_\mathrm{out}-\mathcal{D}\), \(\mathcal{D}\ge 0\). Closed subsystems: \(d\mathcal{K}/dt\le 0\).
- **A1 — Local delayed dynamics (micro)** (complex \(q_i\in\mathbb{C}\)).  
  \(\ddot q_i + 2\gamma_i \dot q_i + \omega_i^2 q_i + \alpha_i |q_i|^2 q_i = \sum_{j\in\mathcal{N}(i)}K_{ij}\sin(A_{ij})\,q_j(t-\tau_{ij}) + \xi_i(t)\).
- **A2 — Spacetime as delay‑graph.**  
- **A3 — Holonomy primacy.** \(W(\ell)=\exp(i\sum A_{ij})\).  
- **A4 — Quantum floor.** Minimal stochastic excitation \(\xi\).  
- **A5 — State‑dependent delays.** \(\tau_{ij}=\tau_{ij}[q,\dot q,\rho]\).  
- **A6 — Coarse‑graining to continuum.** Wave‑with‑memory PDE \(+\;n_\mathrm{eff}(x)\).

### 3. Working equations & continuum (v1.3)
- **Discrete (micro):**  
  \(\ddot q_i + 2\gamma\dot q_i + \omega_0^2 q_i + \alpha |q_i|^2 q_i = \sum_j K_{ij}\sin(A_{ij}) q_j(t-\tau_{ij}) + \xi_i(t)\), with \(\tau_{ij}=\tau_0 + \delta\tau_{ij}[q,\rho]\).
- **Finite‑memory surrogate (Prony chain)** and **continuum PDE with memory** (as in v1.3).

### 4. Emergent “constants” (v1.3)
- \(c \simeq a/\tau_0\);  
- \(\hbar_\mathrm{eff}\) ~ action floor of cycle ensembles; self‑averaging tests;  
- \(G \propto c^2 \alpha_\tau\) with \(n_\mathrm{eff}^2 \simeq 1 + \alpha_\tau \rho\) (constitutive hypothesis).

### 5. Holonomy & atomic/QDT phenomenology (v1.3)
Short loops shift Rydberg‑like energies: \(E_{n\ell}\approx -R_\mathrm{eff}/(n-\delta_\ell)^2\).

### 6. Gravity analogue & antimatter parity (v1.3)
Horizons when \(u > v_g=c/n_\mathrm{eff}\); \(T_H \propto |\partial_x(u-v_g)|\). Matter–antimatter parity at leading order.

### 7. LPC in practice, numerics, predictions (v1.3)
Determinism; finite outputs; self‑averaging; cross‑domain falsification plan.

---

## Part II — DOFT v1.4.1c: Cavity + Skin + Parametric (Preserved)

### 8. Core premises (v1.4.1c)
RE/RCB/IC; layers & time; abrupt shock; destruction needs cycles; cavity+skin; skin gating/pulses; clean↔dirty with breakpoint \(R_*\); **LPC(t)** (early fast → convergent); breathing, local rebounds, inhomogeneous advance; skin states (levels vs bands) with margin \(\mu\); anisotropy & joints; delay kernel \(K(\tau)\) & off‑harmonic noise; residual floor A/B; parametric add‑on (Floquet, symmetry, non‑reciprocity).

### 9. Minimal operational construction (v1.4.1c)
\(\tau_\mathrm{eff}(t)=\tau_{RE}[1+\sigma_{IC}(t)]/d_\mathrm{skin}(t)\); \(LPC(t)=1/\tau_\mathrm{eff}(t)\).  
Observables: \(P_{DOFT}\) (decoherence flux), \(\Phi\) (off‑harmonics), \(\%t_{rest}\), effective delay, \(R_*\), tilt \(n_{DOFT}\), parametric metrics \(\mu_{max}\), NR(dB), etc.

### 10. Deductions, predictions, experiments (v1.4.1c)
\(f\sim 1/R\) (clean), pre‑critical signatures, breathing pulses, levels/bands, anisotropy lowering \(R_*\), parametric thresholds and protection; Phases A–C experiments; configs and CI/validation.

---

## Part III — Unified Physical Framework (New)

### 11. Universal bit = persistent difference
Minimum stable asymmetry (phase/shape) that **survives noise**; not logical 0/1 but a **difference that can be replayed**.

### 12. Resonance as physical memory
A fluctuation + feedback + delay ⇒ **resonance**; the skin is the record‑keeper (quiet windows + pulses).

### 13. Layered memory & meta‑stability
\(\dot M_\ell=\alpha_\ell r_\ell^2-(\beta_\ell N_\ell+\lambda_\ell)M_\ell+\sum_{k\neq\ell}A_{\ell k}M_k\).  
Life‑like meta‑stability at **noise ≈ memory**: \(\lambda_{Lyap}\approx 0\), \(\rho=\sigma_{int}/\sigma_{ext}\approx 1\).

### 14. Cluster = delayed resonance sequence
Finite delays impose **temporal order**; geometry emerges from causal sequencing; explains rebounds and inhomogeneous advance.

### 15. Universal brick
**Self‑sustained oscillator with feedback and delay**. Everything else are configurations of these bricks.

## Part IV — Operational bridge: composite observables
Add to `runs.csv`:
- \(r_\text{hat}=\sigma(a_1\mu + a_2\,\%t_{rest}-a_3\Phi)\)
- \(M_\text{hat}=\dfrac{r_\text{hat}^2}{\epsilon+\Phi}\times\dfrac{1}{\epsilon+P_{DOFT}^{norm}}\)
- \(N_\text{hat}=b_1\Phi+b_2 Var(d_\text{skin})+b_3\sigma_{IC}\)
- \(\rho_{est}=\Phi/P_{DOFT}^{norm}\)
- `lambda_lyap_est` (finite‑window slope of perturbation growth).

Add to `skin.parquet`: `cluster_memory = rest_duty/(eps + local_phi_offharm)` per region.

---

## Part V — Unified predictions & falsifiers
1) \(f\sim 1/R\) (clean) & break \(R_*\).  
2) Pre‑critical: \(d\downarrow\), \(\Phi\uparrow\), \(LPC(t)\downarrow\) to a convergent value.  
3) Breathing: pulse trains + side‑lobes; local rebounds.  
4) Levels vs bands; anisotropy lowers \(R_*\).  
5) Parametric: \(\mu_{max}>0\), NR(dB)>0, protected \(k=0\) with \(\tau=T/n\).  
6) Holonomy/QDT signals; analogue horizons; antimatter parity.  
7) Meta‑stability: \(\rho_{est}\approx 1\), \(\lambda_{Lyap}\approx 0\).

---

## Part VI — Methodology, data, CI (unified)
Integrators with delay buffers; memory kernels via Prony/Vector‑Fitting; determinism; self‑averaging; contracts (`runs.csv`, `edges.parquet`, `skin.parquet`); CI checks and surrogate control \(d\to 1\) ⇒ \(\Phi\downarrow\), \(R_*\) vanishes.

---

## Part VII — Glossary (operational consolidated)
RE, RCB, IC, cavity, skin, \(R\), \(R_*\), \(P_{DOFT}\), \(\Phi\), effective delay, \(LPC(t)\), Floor A/B, \(\mu\), \(C_\perp/C_\parallel\), NR(dB), \(\mu_{max}\), etc.

---

## Part VIII — Local vs Global Memory & Bell‑safe Position (New)

### 16. Position statement
- **DOFT is local‑retarded.** Interactions propagate through finite delays; there is **no instantaneous influence**.  
- Therefore, under standard assumptions (measurement independence, no‑signaling), a **purely local‑retarded model cannot violate Bell‑type inequalities**.  
- We **do not claim** that DOFT reproduces quantum nonlocal correlations.  
- We **do claim** that **global patterns** can emerge from **layered local memories**, producing long‑range correlations **without superluminal channels**.

### 17. Fractal‑like universe & self‑similar build‑up
The rules (resonance + memory + delay) repeat across scales, yielding clumps (“grains”) and bands/windows. This **Mandelbrot‑like intuition** is **operationalized** via measurable exponents (see §19): it is a **scaling hypothesis**, not evidence by analogy.

### 18. What “global memory” means in DOFT
- **Local memory:** retention of correlation at a site/region (skin margin \(\mu\), rest duty, low \(\Phi\)).  
- **Global memory:** **coarse‑grained accumulation** of local memories across layers/regions with delayed couplings. Define
  \[
  M_{global}(t) \;=\; \sum_{i} w_i\, M_i(t) \;+\; \sum_{i\ne j} W_{ij}\, \big[ M_i \star_\tau M_j \big](t),
  \]
  where \(\star_\tau\) denotes a **delay‑aware** correlation integral.  
- This is **not** an extra channel; it is **the same local physics** iterated and coarse‑grained.

### 19. Observable proxies for global memory
- **GCI (Global Coherence Index):** normalized cross‑layer coherence after causal time‑shifts (respecting geodesic delays).  
- **Fractal dimension \(D\):** from cluster‑size distribution and spectral slope of patterns during build‑up (log–log fits).  
- **Memory flow (MF):** net directional transfer of coherence between shells (in/out flux with delays).

**Add to `runs.csv`:** `gci_global, fractal_D, mf_in, mf_out`.

### 20. Temperature/noise as forgetting
Temperature = **rate of coherence loss**; noise couples through the skin via fluctuation–dissipation. A photon interacting with a clump shifts frequency and triggers **breathing**; propagation is **local‑retarded**, yet can generate **complex noise spectra** at macro scales.

### 21. Bell constraints — what DOFT can/cannot reproduce
- Under **locality + measurement independence + fair sampling**, **CHSH \(S\le 2\)** should hold in DOFT.  
- If a simulation yields \(S>2\) without explicit shared randomness between measurement choices, that signals a **violation of assumptions** (e.g., hidden correlation between “choice” devices and the system), or a **bug**.  
- **Macroscopic long‑range correlations** from global memory do **not** imply Bell violation: they result from shared causal past with delays, not from instantaneous influence.

### 22. Measurement disturbance (operational mapping)
A “measurement” perturbs the **skin** (gating + filtering), modifying local resonance and nearby memories. This produces **contextual statistics** (apparatus‑dependent), but remains **Bell‑safe** under locality and independence of settings.

### 23. Falsifiable tests for the global‑memory hypothesis
**T1 — Bell‑safety baseline (in‑silico).**  
- Two distant regions A/B; hidden variable \(\lambda\) drawn locally; settings \(a,b\) drawn from **independent RNGs**; measure binary outcomes from skin‑gated signals.  
- Expect **CHSH \(S\le 2\)** within CI. Any reproducible \(S>2\) suggests setting–system correlation or implementation error.

**T2 — Violating measurement independence on purpose.**  
- Inject a weak shared process \(u(t)\) that slightly correlates \(a,b\) with the field (e.g., bias in RNG seeds).  
- Expect **apparent** \(S>2\) (Bell‑like) even though the model is local; this illustrates how **global memory/hidden common causes** can mimic nonlocal patterns without superluminal signaling.

**T3 — Global coherence scaling.**  
- Measure **GCI** and **fractal \(D\)** vs. system size and duty \(d\).  
- Expect increasing long‑range coherence (higher GCI, stable \(D\)) **without** Bell violation.

**T4 — No‑signaling checks.**  
- Verify that marginal outcome distributions at A do **not** depend on choice \(b\) (and vice‑versa), accounting for causal time shifts.

**Log fields:** `bell_chsh_s, nosignaling_violation_bool, gci_global, fractal_D`.

### 24. Policy for claims
- **We do not assert** that DOFT explains quantum Bell nonlocality.  
- **We do assert** that **macro‑scale, fractal‑like correlations** can emerge from **iterated local memory**, and we provide **tests** to distinguish these from genuine Bell‑type effects.  
- All new claims must be attached to **operational definitions** and **falsifiable protocols**.
