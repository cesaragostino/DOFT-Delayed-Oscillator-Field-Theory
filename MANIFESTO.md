# DOFT Manifesto v1.3

> **Delay-Oscillator Field Theory (DOFT):** a bottom-up framework where spacetime, fields, and “constants” emerge from a large network of coupled oscillators with finite, state-dependent delays. This document consolidates the conceptual core, working equations, testable predictions, critiques addressed so far, and a practical roadmap for simulation and falsification.

---

## 0) One-page overview

- **Ontology:** The universe is modeled as a graph of identical **oscillators** (nodes) connected by **links** that transmit influence with **finite delays**. No pre-given spacetime. Causality and geometry **emerge** from the delay structure.
- **Dynamics:** Each node obeys a **delay differential equation (DDE)** with damping, weak noise (“quantum floor”), and nonlinear, delayed coupling to neighbors. Delays can **depend on the state**, enabling backreaction and gravity-like effects.
- **Emergence:** Coarse-graining produces an effective **wave equation with memory**, an **index of refraction** $n_\mathrm{eff}(x)$ from delay gradients, and **holonomies** on cycles that play the role of gauge phases.
- **Constants:** The **speed limit** emerges as $c \approx a/\tau_0$ (link scale over minimal delay). An effective **Planck’s constant** $\hbar_\mathrm{eff}$ arises from the invariant action area of steady-state cycles sustained by the noise floor. The **Newton constant** $G$ maps to the sensitivity of delays to local energy density.
- **Phenomenology:** DOFT reproduces Rydberg-like spectra via **quantum-defect analogues** from short holonomy loops, links naturally to **analogue gravity** (Hawking radiation from a horizon in $n_\mathrm{eff}$), and predicts **matter/antimatter** to curve the same geometry.
- **Testability:** We define falsifiable **cross-domain** tests (atomic spectra ↔ analogue gravity), **self-averaging** diagnostics, Prony-based kernel identification, and scaling laws for $\hbar_\mathrm{eff}$.
- **New axiom (A0):** **Law of Preservation of Chaos (LPC):** in closed subsystems the “chaos functional” cannot increase without bound; open subsystems can export/import chaos via fluxes. Order appears as dissipative organization of an initial chaotic budget.

---

## 1) Axioms

- **A0 – Law of Preservation of Chaos (LPC).**
There exists a non-negative functional $\mathcal{K}[q]$ (e.g., Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy-rate proxy or sum of positive Lyapunov exponents) with balance
$$\frac{d\mathcal{K}}{dt} = \Phi_\mathrm{in} - \Phi_\mathrm{out} - \mathcal{D}, \qquad \mathcal{D}\ge 0.$$
In closed subsystems $\Phi_\mathrm{in}=\Phi_\mathrm{out}=0\Rightarrow d\mathcal{K}/dt\le 0$.

- **A1 – Local delayed dynamics.** (*microscopic, possibly complex amplitudes* $q_i\in\mathbb{C}$)
$$\ddot q_i + 2\gamma_i \dot q_i + \omega_i^2 q_i + \alpha_i |q_i|^2 q_i
= \sum_{j\in \mathcal{N}(i)} K_{ij}\, \sin\!\big(A_{ij}(t)\big)\, q_j\!\big(t-\tau_{ij}(t)\big) + \xi_i(t).$$
Here $\xi_i$ is a weak, broadband noise (“quantum floor”).

- **A2 – Spacetime as delay-graph.**
The matrix of delays $\{\tau_{ij}\}$ defines cones of influence; geometry and clock rates emerge from path sums of delays.

- **A3 – Holonomy primacy.**
Physical invariants are **loop phases**
$$W(\ell)=\exp\!\Big(i\sum_{(ij)\in \ell} A_{ij}\Big),$$
with link phases $A_{ij}$ accumulated by transport. Local gauge choices are unphysical; only holonomies matter.

- **A4 – Quantum floor.**
A minimal stochastic excitation $\xi$ exists. In v1.2+, this noise is treated as **emergent** from high-dimensional chaotic microdynamics consistent with A0 (Addendum A4′).

- **A5 – State-dependent delays (backreaction).**
$\tau_{ij}=\tau_{ij}\!\big[q,\dot q,\rho\big]$ vary with local fields and coarse energy density $\rho$. Delay gradients generate an effective refractive index and geodesic bending.

- **A6 – Coarse-graining to continuum.**
Block-averaging over mesoscopic patches yields a **wave-with-memory** PDE with kernels $M$ and a spatially varying $n_\mathrm{eff}(x)$.

## 2) Working equations and continuum limit

### 2.1 Discrete graph (micro)
$$\ddot q_i + 2\gamma \dot q_i + \omega_0^2 q_i + \alpha |q_i|^2 q_i = \sum_{j} K_{ij}\, \sin\!\big(A_{ij}\big)\, q_j\!\big(t-\tau_{ij}\big) + \xi_i(t), \qquad \tau_{ij}=\tau_0 + \delta\tau_{ij}[q,\rho].$$

### 2.2 Memory-compressed surrogate
Replace pure delays by a finite Prony chain
$$\dot y_m = -\theta_m y_m + \beta_m q, \qquad q(t-\tau)\;\approx\; \sum_m w_m\, y_m(t), \quad \sum_m w_m \approx 1,$$

with $\{\theta_m,w_m\}$ identified from data via **generalized Prony/Vector-Fitting** to preserve spectra and decay.

### 2.3 Continuum coarse-graining
On scales $\gg a$ (mean link length), a wave-with-memory PDE emerges:
$$
\partial_t^2 \phi + 2\Gamma\,\partial_t \phi + \Omega^2 \phi
-\nabla\!\cdot\!\big(c^2\,n_{\mathrm{eff}}^{-2}(x)\,\nabla \phi\big)
+\int_0^t M\!\left(x,t-t'\right)\,\phi(t')\,\mathrm{d}t'
= \Xi(x,t).
$$

where $c \approx a/\tau_0$ is the emergent causal speed, $n_\mathrm{eff}(x)$ encodes averaged delay gradients (horizons occur when **flow – group speed** changes sign with $v_g=c/n_\mathrm{eff}$), and $M$ inherits the memory poles from $\{\theta_m,w_m\}$.
*Note:* $\Gamma$ is the **effective** macroscopic damping obtained by coarse-graining $\gamma$.

---

## 3) Emergent “constants”

- **Speed limit $c$.**
$$
c \simeq \frac{a}{\tau_0}
$$
up to renormalizations from connectivity and weak disorder.

- **Planck constant $\hbar$ as action floor.**
The stationary stochastic dynamics with A0+A4′ sustains **limit-cycle ensembles** whose phase-space area per cycle stabilizes to
$$
A_0 \equiv \oint p\,dq \;\approx\; 2\pi\, \hbar_\mathrm{eff}.
$$
We estimate $\hbar_\mathrm{eff}$ from local fluctuations as an **operational proxy**
$\;\hbar_\mathrm{eff}\sim \sigma_Q \sigma_P\;$ (up to a numerical factor),
and test **self-averaging** scaling:
$$
\frac{\mathrm{Var}(\hbar_\mathrm{eff})}{\big(\mathbb{E}[\hbar_\mathrm{eff}]\big)^2} \;\sim\; N^{-\beta_\hbar}.
$$

- **Newton constant $G$ as delay-sensitivity map.**
In the continuum,
$$
n_\mathrm{eff}^2(x) \;\simeq\; 1 \;+\; \alpha_\tau\, \rho(x),
\qquad \alpha_\tau \equiv \frac{\partial n_\mathrm{eff}^2}{\partial \rho}.
$$
Linearizing ray bending and matching to weak-field GR gives a constitutive link
$$
G \;\propto\; c^2\,\alpha_\tau,
$$
after proper normalization. This is a working **hypothesis to be derived** from the microdynamics.

## 4) Gauge/holonomy and atomic phenomenology

- **Holonomy as short-loop physics.**
Small cycles around “cores” induce phase defects that shift effective Rydberg energies:
$$
E_{n\ell} \;\approx\; -\frac{R_\mathrm{eff}}{(n-\delta_\ell)^2}, \qquad
\delta_\ell \;\text{from short-loop holonomies and local polarizability}.
$$
- **Predictions:**
(i) Collapse of line families when scaling $\nu_{m}$ by $(n^\*)^3 R_\mathrm{eff}$;
(ii) linear trends of $\delta_\ell$ vs. $1/(n^\*)^2$ with slopes correlated to ionic core **static polarizability** $\alpha_0$;
(iii) Rydberg wave-packet times $T_\mathrm{cl}\propto (n^\*)^3$, $T_\mathrm{rev}\propto (n^\*)^4$.

## 5) Gravity analogue, horizons, and antimatter

- **Index gradient and geodesics.**
Rays follow Fermat in $n_{\mathrm{eff}}(x)$. A **horizon** forms where a drift $u$ exceeds local wave group speed $v_g = c / n_{\mathrm{eff}}$.

- **Hawking analogue.**
$$
T_H \;\propto\; \bigl|\partial_x\big(u - v_g\big)\bigr| \;\;\text{at}\;\; x_H.
$$
In DOFT this depends on $|\partial_x n_{\mathrm{eff}}|$, which is set by delay gradients.

- **Antimatter.**
Curvature depends on the **magnitude** of delay gradients, not the sign of phase. Prediction: **same gravitational response** for matter/antimatter at leading order.

---

## 6) Law of Preservation of Chaos (LPC) in practice

We monitor a chaos proxy $\mathcal{K}$ (finite-window Lyapunov sum, entropy rate, or broadband spectral entropy) and enforce **no blow-up** in closed subsystems. In open subsystems we allow fluxes but require boundedness via mild **chaos braking** (adaptive reduction of fast-memory weights) **only** when $\mathcal{K}$ violates target envelopes—this is a *physical surrogate* for dissipation, not a numerical hack.

---

## 7) Critiques addressed (and what remains)

1. **“Analogies ≠ causation.”**
We use analogues to choose **falsifiable observables**; we do **not** infer identity. The programme is *predict → test → reject/retain parameters* across domains.

2. **Coarse-graining rigor.**
The PDE with memory is not assumed; we **derive** kernels by Prony/Vector-Fitting from micro time-series, then validate via **a posteriori** error bounds (residual energy, BIBO stability, passivity).

3. **DDE intractability.**
We replace pure delays by **few-pole** memory that preserves dominant poles/zeros; convergence is checked by **model-order increase until residuals plateau**.

4. **Non-self-averaging at criticality.**
We explicitly **measure** scaling exponents $\beta_\hbar,\beta_c$. If they do not approach 1 (strong self-averaging) in the regimes claimed to be universal, DOFT **fails** there.

5. **Emergent constants still “sketched.”**
Correct: $\hbar, G$ derivations must be **closed**. We outline a stochastic-invariant action proof for $\hbar_\mathrm{eff}$ and a constitutive derivation for $G$; both are priority items in the roadmap.

---

## 8) Testable predictions & falsification

### 8.1 Cross-domain tie-down
- Fit $R_\mathrm{eff}$ and $\delta_\ell(n)$ on **one** alkali (e.g., Cs).
- **Without retuning**, predict: (i) wave-packet times; (ii) $\nu$ collapse; (iii) analogue-gravity $T_H$ vs. $\partial_x n_\mathrm{eff}$ in a **mapped** optical/BEC device.
- **Fail** of (iii) given success of (i–ii) → refutation of common mechanism.

### 8.2 Self-averaging of $\hbar_\mathrm{eff}$
- Partition the network into $d=2,4,8,16,32,\dots$ blocks; compute
$$
R(d)=\frac{\mathrm{Var}(\hbar_\mathrm{eff})}{\big(\mathbb{E}[\hbar_\mathrm{eff}]\big)^2}.
$$
- Fit $\log R = -\beta_\hbar \log N + b$; **expect** $\beta_\hbar \approx 1$ in homogeneous regimes.
- **Fail** (persistent $\beta_\hbar \ll 1$) → noise is not homogeneous or the coarse-grain model is wrong.

### 8.3 Hawking analogue slope
- Measure $T_H$ vs. $\partial_x(u-v_g)$; DOFT predicts proportionality with coefficient set by memory-kernel curvature. Mismatch beyond bounds → reject kernel identification or A5 parametrization.

### 8.4 Antimatter gravity
- Any leading-order deviation between matter/antimatter geodesics conflicts with DOFT’s phase-insensitive curvature.

## 9) Numerical methodology (for collaborators)

- **Integrator:** explicit or semi-implicit schemes with delay-buffers; for memory surrogate use ODE solvers with adaptive steps and **energy monitors**.
- **Kernel ID:** generalized **Prony/Vector-Fitting** on node/cluster impulse responses; enforce **stability & passivity**; report $L_2$ residuals and Hankel singular values.
- **Uncertainty:** bootstrap across disorder seeds and lattice realizations; report CIs on $\beta_\hbar$, $c$, $\hbar_\mathrm{eff}$.
- **LPC audit:** track $\mathcal{K}(t)$, chaos-flux counters, and “brake” interventions; interventions must **decrease** $\mathcal{K}$ in closed subsystems.
- **Reproducibility artifacts:** CSVs for summaries, per-run logs, and time-series; JSON for parameters; seeds/version pins.
