# DOFT-Delayed-Oscillator-Field-Theory
Reference implementation, experiments, and analysis pipeline for DOFTâ€”a bottom-up, network-dynamics framework where the building blocks are identical oscillators coupled through retarded links. In DOFT, space, time, fields, and gravitation are not fundamental objects; they emerge from the causal pattern of delays and phases on a large graph.
